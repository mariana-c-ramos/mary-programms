## Welcome to my own Portfolio Project!
I'm Mariana, a frontend developer and this is my portfolio - a project designed and built in my Web Desing course, with the main goal to cross my knowledge of design, development and marketing (SEO), in just one project.

Bellow you have an index with the process and overall journey from concept to the final project - enjoy!

### CONCEPT
Miana Programms is my online portfolio, in which I will showcase my personal projects, my career path and a little bit about me.

The main goal was to really explore my new knowledge in PHP, and try to do a dynamic website.

For the majority of the project I used PHP to inject the content into the specific pages, and a bit of JavaScript for some details.
### TOOLS-TECNOLOGIES
For this projects I used:

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT**
- Trello
- Notion

**DESIGN**
- Figma
- Word

**CODE**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- jQuery lib for a swiper component
- PHP
- SQL
### PROCESS
I followed the list bellow to build this project:
- Start project folder and create a folder for assets, css and javascript files
- Create the index page and folders for specific pages and components
- Upload the images and assets needed for the project
- Build Homepage
- Build About me
- Build Career
- Build Contact

After these was done, I started building the challenging parts: a blog and an admin area to control my content.

**BLOG**
The plan was to make a blog that would get the content from a database. That database would be populated by an admin area with a blog editor.

**ADMIN**
- Create a login/register area
- A blog editor
- A project manager area (not done)

Note: in each file I have left comments to explain better the code and what I learned with each part of the project.
